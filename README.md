The logical system will receive airplanes for landing or takeoff and will guide them through the following route:

Landing:
Approach for landing - from point 1 to points 2 and 3 in that order.
Landing - at point 4.
parking stand - to 5 and evacuation at stands 6 or 7. If a stand is occupied, the airplane will wait at the point.

Takeoff:
An airplane scheduled for takeoff will start (appear) at point 6 or 7 and then continue to point 8, from there to 4 for takeoff, and then to 9 (after takeoff).
