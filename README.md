# Flight-control
The simulator will simulate airplanes approaching for landing at point 1.

The simulator will simulate airplanes that wish to take off.

The logical system will receive airplanes for landing or takeoff and will guide them through the following route:

Landing:
Approach for landing - from point 1 to points 2 and 3 in that order.
Landing - at point 4.
parking stand - to 5 and evacuation at stands 6 or 7. If a stand is occupied, the airplane will wait at the point.

Takeoff:
An airplane scheduled for takeoff will start (appear) at point 6 or 7 and then continue to point 8, from there to 4 for takeoff, and then to 9 (after takeoff).
